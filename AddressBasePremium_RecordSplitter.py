PREREQUISITE

	Python 2.7 - this script has only been tested against Python 2.7

SYNOPSIS

    To run script: python AddressBasePremium_RecordSplitter.py

DESCRIPTION

    This Python script can be used to seperate each AddressBase Premium 
    CSV file into new CSV files based on the record identifiers found 
    within AddressBase Premium. The script will read both AddressBase Premium 
    CSV files and zipped CSV files. If you have zipped files it is unneccessary
    to extract the zip file first as the script reads data directly from the zip
    file.
