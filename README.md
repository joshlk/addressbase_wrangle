Wrangle AddressBase Premium into a usable format as what [OS](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/) provide is ðŸ’©

## Useful links
* [AddressBase Support page](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/help-and-support/products/addressbase-premium.html)

## Steps
Firstly order Address Base Premium from OS (it's free with restrictions):

1. Sign up to OS's [Data Exploration Licence](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/licensing/licences/data-exploration.html)
2. Order Address Base Premium CSV version through the [portal](https://orders.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/orders/)

Then download all files:

1. Navigate to [order download page](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/orderdownload/orders)
2. Click on the order and then save the page as a HTML using your browser and save it into the root folder of this directory
3. Make a folder called `zip_download` in root folder
4. Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder and start a `scrapy shell` ([scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) must be installed)
5. Run the following python code (substitute the first line with the HTML file):

```python
fetch("Ordnance Survey Download Centre.html")
links = response.xpath('//*[@id="orderLinks"]/li[*]/a/@href').getall()

import urllib
from urlparse import urlparse
import os

for i, link in enumerate(links):
    while True:
        try:
            file_name = os.path.basename(urlparse(link).path)
            urllib.request.urlretrieve(link, os.path.join("zip_download", file_name))
            break
        except:
            print("Failed: {}".format(file_name))
```

There are around 10,964 files so will take a couple of hours.

To extract and append files:

1. Make a folder `zip_extract` in root directory
2. Extract all zip files. In Windows PowerShell use `Get-ChildItem 'zip_download' -Filter *.zip | Expand-Archive -DestinationPath 'zip_extract' -Force`, on other platforms use (? please suggest)
3. Run `python2 AddressBasePremium_RecordSplitter.py` (it must be Python2 otherwise you get into unicode issues)
4. Specify the full path to the directory `zip_extract`
